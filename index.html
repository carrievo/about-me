    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p>
      <b>My name is Carrie Vo.</b> I received my B.A. in Developmental Child Psychology at the University of Minnesota. I have some background in mortgage which opened the door for me at Zillow on the Data Acquisition Team where I acquire and review public data. I've always been fascinated with how our website and the software we use work, so I'm really excited to learn more about it and transition into a career in Software Development!
